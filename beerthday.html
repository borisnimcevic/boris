One of my favorite things to do is to have good beer and even better conversions with my close friends. 
Therefore I am planning to do just that on my birthday. 
I am doing a three-stop bar hop on Saturday, October 1st, and I would like you to join me.

The rough plan is as follows:
<br/>
<p>
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Place</th>
    <th>Address</th> 
    <th>Time</th>
    <th>Comment</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Omnipollos kyrka</td>
    <td>Sturegatan 41, 172 31 Sundbyberg</td>
    <td>table reserved from 17</td>
    <td>N/A</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Stockholm Brewing Co.</td>
    <td>Frihamnsgatan 26A, 115 56 Stockholm</td>
    <td>table reserved from 19:15</td>
    <td>Excellent food. I recommend eating dinner here.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Oliver Twist</td>
    <td>Repslagargatan 6, 118 46 Stockholm</td>
    <td>arrive around 21:30ish... or depends how people feel at the previous place</td>
    <td>N/A</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>
I hope you join me for the whole evening, but feel free to hop on-off the train whenever you feel like.
The best place to reach me is on Whatsapp, Telegram or Signal. Although that might get progressively harder as the night moves on.

<h3>FAQ (that nobody actually asked me)</h3>

Join my girlfreind's "C'mon, are you 7?!" club.<br>
<br/>

<b>Will there be food?</b><br>
Yes, by law they are required to serve some kind of food. Or at least that's what people told me... idk, I don't look up stuff.<br>
(but yes... Stockholm Brewing Co. is another level food. I really recommend it.)<br>
<br/>

<b>Are there other drinks besides beer?</b><br>
Maybe? I never looked past beer. There's water for sure.<br>
<br/>

<b>What should I get you for present?</b><br>
Nothing, pay for your drinks. They are already expensive enough. (especially in Omnipollos, jeez)<br>
<br/>

<b>But I really need to bring something. (not really a question, I know)</b><br>
Sure, but keep in mind that I would have to carry it.<br>
